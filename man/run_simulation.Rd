\arguments{
\item{inputDataFile}{string; path to data file}

\item{speaker}{string; column name for speaker code}

\item{group}{string; column name for agent group}

\item{word}{string; column name for word labels}

\item{phoneme}{string; column name for canonical phonological labels (does not have to be specified if useFlexiblePhonology is TRUE)}

\item{features}{string or vector of strings; column name(s) for acoustic features}

\item{subsetSpeakers}{vector of strings; speakers to be included in simulation}

\item{subsetPhonemes}{string or vector of strings; canonical phonological label(s) to be included in the simulation}

\item{createBootstrappedPopulation}{boolean; whether to create an agent population using bootstrap or have every speaker represented by one agent}

\item{bootstrapPopulationSize}{full positive number or named vector of full positive numbers; amount of agents (per group) in bootstrap scenario}

\item{initialMemoryResampling}{boolean; whether or not to increase number of tokens per word and agent before simulation start}

\item{initialMemoryResamplingFactor}{full positive number; factor by which to increase the agents' memories before the simulation if initialMemoryResampling is TRUE}

\item{removeOriginalExemplarsAfterResampling}{boolean; whether or not to remove original exemplars if initialMemoryResampling is TRUE}

\item{productionBasis}{"word" or "phoneme"; which categories to use as sampling basis in production}

\item{productionResampling}{boolean; whether or not to use SMOTE in production to make computation of Gaussians more stable}

\item{productionResamplingFallback}{"phoneme" or NULL;}

\item{productionMinTokens}{full positive number; minimum of tokens to be used to compute a Gaussian to sample from in production as well as number of tokens per word class and agent not to be undercut through forgetting}

\item{productionSMOTENN}{full positive number; number of nearest neighbours to use for SMOTE}

\item{memoryIntakeStrategy}{"acceptAll" or "mahalanobisDistance" and/or "maxPosteriorProb" or "posteriorProbThr"; decision criteria for memorisation}

\item{mahalanobisProbThreshold}{number between 0 and 1; probability threshold if memoryIntakeStrategy contains "mahalanobisDistance"}

\item{posteriorProbThreshold}{number between 0 and 1; probability threshold if memoryIntakeStrategy contains "posteriorProbThr"}

\item{perceptionOOVNN}{full positive number; amount of nearest neighbours to use to assign a phonological label to token of unknown word class}

\item{forgettingRate}{number between 0 and 1; if a number generated from a uniform distribution is smaller than this threshold, the agent listener removes a token from memory}

\item{useFlexiblePhonology}{boolean; whether to use GMM and NMF to autonomously compute and update phonological classes or use fixed phonological labels (as given by argument "phoneme")}

\item{computeGMMsInterval}{full positive number; after how many accepted new tokens to re-compute GMM and NMF if useFlexiblePhonology is TRUE}

\item{purityRepetitions}{positive full number; how often to recompute the purity calculation to make sure it is robust if useFlexiblePhonology is TRUE}

\item{purityThreshold}{number between 0 and 1; how pure a phonological class has to be at the least if useFlexiblePhonology is TRUE}

\item{interactionPartners}{"random" or "betweenGroups" or "withinGroups"; whether interacting agents should come from same or different groups or be randomly chosen}

\item{speakerProb}{NULL or vector of numbers; one number per agent to indicate how likely the agent is to become agent speaker}

\item{listenerProb}{NULL or vector of numbers; one number per agent to indicate how likely the agent is to become agent listener}

\item{runSingleSimulation}{boolean; whether to run a single simulation or multiple runs of the same simulation}

\item{multipleABMRuns}{full positive number; number of runs if runSingleSimulation is FALSE}

\item{nrOfSnapshots}{full positive number; number of snapshots, i.e. how often the state of the population shall be saved}

\item{interactionsPerSnapshot}{full positive number; number of interactions per snapshot}

\item{rootLogDir}{string; path to logging directory (will be created if it does not exist yet)}

\item{notes}{string; optional notes on the simulation}
